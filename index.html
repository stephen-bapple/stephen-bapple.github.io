            <p>I am a software engineer with over 4 years of experience developing software.</p>

            <p> My experience has primarily been in the backend. I have also done extensive e2e automation and tooling work, as well as a good helping of infrastructure/devOps, with UI/frontend as needed.</p>
            
            <p>That said, I consider myself a generalist, which to me means that I pick up tools as I need them and go where I am needed. I am more focused on the product that is built than the tools that build it, I feel most fulfilled when building stuff that people can actually use and enjoy.</p>
            
            <p>I got my career started as a test engineer, poking around and messing with software, and used that curiosity to make myself an expert on the product and power all my engineering efforts from then onwards. </p>
            
            <p>My passion for tech in general started similarly; 
            as a small child I watched my older siblings play old DOS games as well as create their own small ones. 
            I became absolutely fascinated with how these old games worked, the bugs and glitches, as well as the 
            program they used to make their own. Although I spent most of my childhood with sparse computer access, 
            I majored in computer science, and then when I started coding professionally I fell in love with the craft itself.
            I saw it as so much wider than video games. After all, my first company was a cybersecurity firm, and the second in healthcare, 
            and I'm excited to see what else is out there!</p>
            <p>Currently I am working on an Android app to track, categorize, and get jokes to tell from.</p>

                <h3>Jokes on the Go</h3>
                <p>This project was mainly started in order to pratice my UI skills, Golang and really learn Kotlin. 
                It's mostly an excuse, but I love to tell corny dad-type jokes and struggle to keep track of which ones I've told to whom. So, I'll build an app for that. </p>
                <h4>Hightlights / What's working so far</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Uses gRPC to communicate between client and server</li>
                    <li>gRPC stubs published automatically on tag in Github Actions, downloaded in separate Android repo</li>
                    <li>Jetpack Compose provides the UI, although it doesn't do much yet</li>
                    <li>Server and client use tls and client is authenticated with an API key</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Planned features</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Host server on real publically accessible domain name</li>
                    <li>Use a real certificate authority to avoid self-signed cert scripting</li>
                    <li>Use postgres to store a lot of jokes</li>
                    <li>Implement tagging and audience tracking</li>
                    <li>Add "Add API key" feature to Android app</li>
                    <li>Publish android APK for easy install</li>
                    <li>Build a more functional and visually pleasing UI</li>
                </ul>
