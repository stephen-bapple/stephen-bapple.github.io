                <div class="intro-text">
                    <p>I am a software engineer with over 4 years of experience developing software.</p>

                    <p>
                        I've spent the bulk of my career working on backends powering core business functions
                        in addition to doing extensive work automating both e2e and integration tests,
                        even going so far as to build out new tools and frameworks in order to enable these efforts.
                        This has naturally included a lot of infrastructure and developer tooling work, pushing me
                        closer to the Ops wheelhouse
                        than many backend engineers, but I have also worked with UI/frontend as needed and consider
                        myself a generalist;
                        I pick up tools as I need them and go where I am needed.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I started my career as a test engineer in a context-driven style shop,
                        poking around and experimenting with software (whether that was with code or mouse pointer)
                        and the experience greatly influenced my understanding of quality.
                        It's not the number of bugs or how quirky a UI element is;
                        but whether the top needs of the business are being met and the stakeholders find the product
                        valuable.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        My passion for tech in general started similarly;
                        as a small child I watched my older siblings play old DOS games as well as create their own
                        small ones.
                        I became absolutely fascinated with how these old games worked, the bugs and glitches,
                        as well as a program they used to make their own. Although I spent most of my childhood with
                        sparse computer access,
                        I majored in computer science, and then when I started coding professionally I fell in love with
                        the craft itself.
                        I saw it as so much wider than video games, to me software is the great enabler, whether you
                        want to tell a
                        story, solve a business process issue, or connect with people across the world, software can
                        make it possible.

                        After all, my first company was a cybersecurity firm, and the second in healthcare, and I'm
                        excited to see what else is out there!
                    </p>

                    <p>Currently I am working on an Android app to track, categorize, and get jokes to tell from.</p>

                        <h3>Jokes on the Go</h3>
                        <p>This project was mainly started in order to practice both my UI skills and Golang as well as
                            really learn Kotlin.
                            It's mostly an excuse, but I love to tell corny dad-type jokes and struggle to keep track of
                            which ones I've told to whom. So, I'll build an app for that. </p>
                        <p>Right now the app and server are both very barebones.
                            I chose to get the connection working first so in order to prove out all relevant
                            technologies.
                            In the past I've encountered difficulties getting gRPC or imitators to work with certain
                            tech stacks, and changing API technology can be painful, so I wanted to remove that risk.
                            I particularly love this pattern for development as stubbing out server responses
                            is a great way to parallelize development work.</p>
                        <h4>Highlights / What's working so far</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Uses gRPC to communicate between client and server</li>
                            <li>gRPC stubs are published automatically on tag in Github Actions, to be downloaded in
                                separate Android repo</li>
                            <li>Jetpack Compose provides the UI, although it doesn't do much yet</li>
                            <li>Server is hosted on a Raspberry PI, with the gRPC API exposed at jokesonethego.com</li>
                            <li>Server uses certbot/letsencrypt for TLS, and the client is authenticated with an API key
                            </li>
                            <li>Server is continually built and deployed via Github Actions, a webhook, and systemd
                                wizardry</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Planned features</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Use postgres to store a lot of jokes</li>
                            <li>Implement tagging and audience tracking</li>
                            <li>Add "Add API key" feature to Android app</li>
                            <li>Publish android APK for easy install</li>
                            <li>Build a more functional and visually pleasing UI</li>
                            <li>...Even more features as the app is fleshed out and the need arises</li>
                        </ul>
